With the pandemic impacting all our lives, this has forced many of us to reevaluate our lives whether it is our relationships, career, finances, etc. Although I am incredibly lucky in my living situation, I realized that I didn't want to sit in my computer 8 hours every SINGLE day. I would rather spend time with friends and family, pursue different passions, travel, or WHATEVER I want. I believe if I put the work to learn pick high quality businesses, I would be set for life. Jeff Bezos said to Shaq O'Neal that he picks businesses that change lives, so lets do the same!

I am in my mid twenties working in the Bay Area as a data science/engineer. I have read lots of forums, videos, books, and even coded my own investment 101. Just like you, I am learning. 

My strategy to invest: 
  1. Long-term investing consists a bulk of my money with a mixture ~45%/45%/10% (dividend, dividend growth, growth stocks) I heard this quote from Kevin O'Leary who **values** cash flow as his priority. If I have a 150k portfolio at ~3% dividend = $4500 every year + dividend CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) + stock appreciation. You can invest this $4500 in a new growth stock, reinvest into your current portfolio, or withdraw it for your own use. Cash flow provides you flexibility and having this long term portfolio that compounds annually from dividends + your own money will exponentially grow your net worth. 
  2. Covered calls and cash secured puts - search up wheel strategy and this will provide you safe returns. Warren Buffett sells contracts if you look at Berkshire Hathway's statements under "Derivatives..." The reason why this strategy is effective is if you pick a business to run the wheel you will never feel disatisfied and hopefully never lose. 
  
My forecast for the strategy is at least 10 years. It takes time and consistency to grow your baby and I believe with having dividends + options premiums + depositing money from jobs/businesses/side hustles, financial freedom is quicker than you'll think. 

In the future, I am looking to learn how to trade other options strategies (spreads, strangles, etc.) and swing/day trade as well. I believe other options strategies provide different growth opportunities for all investors. Also swing/day trading will enable me to learn about technical of the stock market a lot better. (I don't really want to day trade, because thats basically an 8 hour job, but I need to keep my mind open for all opportunities) Learning technicals also mean I can pick better prices to enter my positions for my long term positions as well. 

My mom said that regardless if you have 100k, a million, ten million, we all live the same Earth and eat the same foods. (Yes I know, some will probably eat suckling pig or truffles with pizza every day) So continue to grow yourself but also grow your surroundings and that will be the ulltimate compounding growth :)
